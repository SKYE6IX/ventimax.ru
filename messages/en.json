      "highlight": "This fully automated system lets you set and forget your desired temperature, with multi-level heating adjustment for customized comfort. Its advanced ceramic heating technology saves 30% energy while withstanding harsh conditions like humid livestock barns.",
      "description": "The system offers automatic control, allowing you to set the desired temperature for fully automated operation and shutdown of the electric heating fan, enabling unmanned operation. It features multiple firepower levels, letting you freely select the heating speed and gradient from one level to several based on heating needs and power conditions. It includes delay protection with multiple levels of delayed start to prevent excessive instantaneous starting current from impacting the power grid. The fan also has a delayed stop to utilize all residual heat, protecting the heating element. The ceramic heating is durable and energy-efficient, ideal for challenging environments like livestock and poultry houses or greenhouses with high ammonia and humidity. The specially designed extinction heating tube saves up to 30% more electricity. The fan is ultra-quiet, using an external rotor design with strong airflow and low noise, meeting household standards. It’s easy to use and heats quickly, requiring only electricity (single-phase or three-phase). It reaches maximum heat capacity within 10 minutes of being powered on."
